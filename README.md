# Banking Application User Page - a Practice Project

My version of a bank user page based on a really well made online course project.
[Preview on Github](https://mgrzb451.github.io/webdevpractice-fakebank1-/)


## I practiced and learned

* Working with forms, inputs, buttons
* Working with dates, times, numbers and formats - `Temporal` and `Intl`
* Working with timers
* Closures, scopes for variables and functions - quite different from Python!
* Laying out elements with `display:grid` and controling the page's behaviour with it
* Implementing a very simplistic login/logout mechanic

## Thoughts
As I was implementing the functionality in JavaScript I kept spotting lots of opportunities for going back and refactoring the code to streamline functionality, avoid repeated operations and optimize compute utilization. This emphasizes the value of properly planning out the functionality of the project beforehand but also shows how important it is to constantly improve and iterate as you code.


Even though the page is quite simple the need to split the JS file into multiple modules is quite apparent. In python I'd have done that right away. Next project I'll be prepared to do that in JS as well - great opportunity to learn how to handle multi-module applications in Javascript for the 1st time!


There is a reason why real websites use CSS classes to target elements rather than HTML names - it makes it so much easier to reuse them and manipulate them with Javascript. I have to get used to it!
